## Overview

ACCOMPANY employs a stark, high-contrast aesthetic reminiscent of gallery walls, using bold typography as primary visual elements against an expansive white canvas. Text is predominantly black, creating a declarative and direct brand voice. Accent colors are introduced sparingly through large, impactful imagery, rather than integrated throughout the UI, preserving the monochromatic purity of the interface. Components are minimal, relying on subtle borders and text-based interactions.

## Colors

| Name | Hex | Group | Role |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Canvas White | `#ffffff` | neutral | Page backgrounds, card surfaces, and primary visual space |
| Ink Black | `#000000` | neutral | Dark borders and separators for elevated surfaces and inverted UI. Do not promote it to the primary CTA color |
| Border Grey | `#0a0a0a` | neutral | Subtle borders and separators, providing minimal visual interruption |

## Components

### Navigation Link

**Role:** Top-level navigation items.

Uses SyndicatGroteskMedium, weight 400, 16px, with a 1.0 line height. On hover, a 1px Ink Black border appears below the text.

### Text Button

**Role:** Minimal interactive buttons.

Text uses Arial, weight 400, 13px, Ink Black. Padding is 10px vertical and 0px horizontal. No background color, blending seamlessly with the Canvas White.

### Feature Card

**Role:** Displays featured content or news items.

Defined by a 1px Ink Black border around the perimeter. Internal padding is 21px around content. Background is Canvas White.

## Layout

The page maintains a centered, max-width layout (though the exact width isn't specified, content rarely touches the viewport edges). The hero section is characterized by a central, large headline (Items-Light) over a full-bleed, gradient image. Sections alternate between expansive whitespace for text-heavy blocks and full-width visual sections. Content often uses single-column centered text or two-column layouts where text and supporting visuals are cleanly separated, often within Ink Black bordered containers. Navigation is a simple top-right text-based menu. The overall feel is spacious and uncrowded, emphasizing large typography and impactful visuals.

## Imagery

Imagery primarily consists of large, often full-bleed abstract or conceptual digital art, rich in gradients and vibrant colors, serving as evocative visual anchors rather than direct product representations. They are presented without rounded corners or complex masking, acting as standalone statement pieces within the stark UI. There are also product/process-focused flat graphics and subtle screenshots, typically contained within monochrome frames, for explanatory content. Icons are minimal, represented by simple Ink Black outlines.

## Dos & Donts

### Do

- Prioritize Canvas White (#ffffff) as the dominant background for all major sections.
- Use Ink Black (#000000) for all text, borders, and functional iconography to maintain high contrast.
- Apply Items-Light (weight 400, 80px) with -0.02em letter spacing for prominent headlines to achieve a refined, impactful presence.
- Employ SyndicatGroteskMedium (weight 400) with -0.03em letter spacing for subheadings and body text where a modern sans-serif is needed.
- Maintain generous vertical spacing between content sections, using 71px as a standard section gap.
- Implement 1px Ink Black borders as a primary visual divider and component container, rather than shadows or filled backgrounds.
- Integrate large, full-bleed images as visual anchors, allowing their internal colors to provide the only chromatic variation on the page.

### Don't

- Avoid using saturated or chromatic colors for UI elements such as backgrounds or text outside of imagery.
- Do not introduce shadows or complex elevation schemes; rely on borders and whitespace for visual separation.
- Refrain from using heavily filled buttons or complex component designs; favor ghost buttons and text links.
- Do not deviate from the specified typography and letter-spacing pairings; they are crucial for the brand's voice.
- Avoid decorative gradients in UI elements; gradients are reserved for large, hero-style imagery.
- Do not clutter layouts with small, contained images. Imagery should be expansive and singular in impact.
