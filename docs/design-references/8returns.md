## Overview

8returns presents a high-contrast interface with a dark, commanding hero offset by clean, bright content sections. The visual style balances product-focused professionalism with interactive vibrancy, primarily through a luminous green accent. Surfaces are subtly rounded, and components maintain a lightweight yet distinct presence, fostering an approachable user experience within a data-intensive domain. The system employs structured layouts with generous spacing to clarify complex information while maintaining visual order.

### Product Display Card (Lagoon Teal)

**Role:** Card for showcasing product screenshots or specific feature blocks.

Background: Lagoon Teal (#004853), Radius: 16px, Box Shadow: none, Padding: 0px.

### Neutral Content Card (Light Smoke)

### Testimonial Card

**Role:** Elevated card for testimonials or user-generated content.

Background: Paper White (#ffffff), Radius: 16px, Box Shadow: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1) 0px 1px 3px 0px, rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.06) 0px 1px 2px 0px, Padding: 0px.

### Interactive List Item Card

**Role:** Card for interactive list items, often seen in product UI simulations.

Background: Silver Mist (#bfbfbf), Radius: 0px, Box Shadow: none, Padding: 0px.

### Navigation Link

**Role:** Top-level navigation items in headers.

Text: Midnight Ink (#051923), no explicit background, no radius, no padding in typical header usage.

## Layout

The page adheres to a max-width contained layout, likely around 1200px, with content centered. The hero section is full-bleed and dark, featuring a large, centered headline over a background that often includes product UI simulations. Subsequent sections alternate between light (#eef0f2) and Paper White (#ffffff) backgrounds, creating a clear visual rhythm. Content is generally arranged in two-column text and image sections, sometimes reversing order. Feature blocks often consolidate into 3-column card grids. There's a generous vertical spacing between sections, contributing to a comfortable density. Navigation is a sticky top bar with clearly defined links and two action buttons on the right.

## Imagery

This site uses a mix of visually rich elements. Photography features tightly cropped product shots on pure white or subtle minimalist backgrounds, focusing on the product itself with a clean, high-key treatment. For testimonials and social proof, candid lifestyle photography with a natural, unposed feel is used, often within rounded cards. Illustrations are not prominent. Icons are minimal, typically outlined and monochrome, with an apparent stroke weight, serving functional roles rather than decorative. Product screenshots are integral, often presented within a Lagoon Teal (#004853) masked card container to simulate in-app experiences. Imagery serves both decorative atmosphere in hero sections and explanatory content within feature blocks, with a text-dominant layout giving imagery specific, contained roles.

## Dos & Donts

### Do

- Prioritize Midnight Ink (#051923) for dark backgrounds and primary textual content, especially headlines.
- Use Spring Green (#cfff69) exclusively for primary calls-to-action and key interactive highlights, never for large content blocks.
- Maintain a clear visual hierarchy with Roobert font, utilizing various weights to distinguish headings from body text.
- Apply 32px border-radius consistently to all prominent buttons and 16px to cards for a cohesive, friendly feel.
- Ensure generous spacing, with 24px section gaps and 4px element gaps, to maintain content readability and comfortable density.
- Utilize Paper White (#ffffff) and Light Smoke (#eef0f2) for backgrounds in light content sections, providing visual breathing room.
- Employ ghost buttons with 0px radius where secondary actions are needed, using either Midnight Ink or Paper White for text and border depending on the background.

### Don't

- Avoid using Spring Green (#cfff69) as a general decorative color or for extensive text, as it should signal interactivity.
- Do not deviate from the Roobert font family; consistency across all text elements is critical for brand recognition.
- Refrain from introducing new border radii; stick to the established 32px for buttons and 16px for cards.
- Do not place large blocks of text in Midnight Ink (#051923) on Paper White (#ffffff) backgrounds; use Lead Gray (#525252) for body copy on light surfaces.
- Avoid overly bold or decorative shadows beyond the defined card shadow, as the system relies on subtle elevation.
- Do not use saturated colors for borders, with the exception of the Spring Green (#cfff69) accent color for specific interactive states.
- Do not introduce gradients other than Twilight Gradient, Oceanic Gradient, or Skybound Gradient, and only for their defined atmospheric or accent roles.
