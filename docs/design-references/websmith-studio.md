## Components

### Primary Filled Button

**Role:** Main call-to-action button for initiating key actions

Solid Ink background (#1a1a1a) with Fog text (#ffffff), 8px border-radius, and generous 16px vertical, 32px horizontal padding. The stark contrast ensures it stands out without being loud.

### Content Card - Default

**Role:** Container for product showcases, case studies, and informational blocks

Fog background (#ffffff), 12px border-radius, no shadow, and 32px internal padding on all sides. Used for a clean, contained presentation of content.

### Content Card - Mint Accent

**Role:** Alternative content card for visual variation or thematic grouping

Mint background (#a4f4cf), 12px border-radius, no shadow, and 32px internal padding. Offers a soft chromatic variation for specific content.

### Content Card - Sky Accent

**Role:** Alternative content card for visual variation or thematic grouping

Sky Tint background (#bedbff), 12px border-radius, no shadow, and 32px internal padding. Introduces a cool chromatic nuance for content grouping.

### Content Card - Blush Accent

**Role:** Alternative content card for visual variation or thematic grouping

Blush background (#ffc9c9), 12px border-radius, no shadow, and 32px internal padding. Provides a warm, muted background for particular content blocks.

### Navigation Link

**Role:** Top-level navigation items

Ink text (#1a1a1a) at 16px size, weight 400. Hover state should show a subtle underline without color change, maintaining elegance.

### Header Logo

**Role:** Brand identity in the header

Websmith logo uses Deep Space (#000000) for high contrast and immediate brand recognition at 16px font size.

### Feature Box (Plan/Build)

**Role:** Small informational boxes describing services

Card-like components with 12px border-radius and 32px padding, using varied soft accent colors (#bedbff, #a4f4cf, #ffc9c9) as backgrounds. Typography is Ink (#1a1a1a) 30px for titles, 16px for descriptions.

## Layout

The page maintains a max-width contained layout of 1340px, centered on the Canvas background. The hero section features a prominent, centered headline and subtext. Content follows a rhythm of alternating section types: large text blocks, 2-column card grids for collaborations and features, and a testimonial block with an image alongside text. Vertical section gaps are generous (64-96px), creating breathing room. Navigation is a sticky top bar with logo left and textual links right. There are distinct section headers aligned left, followed by the respective content blocks.

## Imagery

The site predominantly uses contained product screenshots, often depicting devices (phones, tablets, laptops) displaying digital user interfaces. These images are typically full-color, sharp, and placed within cards with 12px rounded corners. Photography is minimal, appearing in black and white for testimonials, treated with a softer, slightly desaturated feel. Icons are monochrome, simple, and outlined, serving as functional or decorative visual cues within content blocks.

## Dos & Donts

### Do

- Prioritize the Canvas (#f8f8f2) for page backgrounds, reserving Fog (#ffffff) for contained UI surfaces like cards.
- Use Ink (#1a1a1a) for all primary text, headlines, and interactive elements to maintain high contrast and legibility.
- Apply a consistent 12px border-radius to all image containers, content cards, and major UI blocks for a unified soft aesthetic.
- Maintain ample negative space using elementGap up to 16px and sectionGap up to 96px, allowing content to breathe.
- Use the system font `-apple-system` with `letter-spacing: -0.025em` for headlines 48px and larger, to achieve a tight, modern typographic feel.
- Introduce subtle accent colors (Mint, Sky Tint, Blush) primarily as card backgrounds for visual differentiation, avoiding their use as primary text or action colors.
- Keep elevation minimal or absent; when used, rely on subtle borders rather than heavy shadows to define elements.

### Don't

- Never use vibrant saturated colors for large UI areas; they are reserved for small, functional accent points like the Online Green status dot.
- Avoid decorative gradients; the design relies on flat colors and subtle textural differences between surfaces.
- Do not introduce strong drop shadows; the system prefers a flat, clean aesthetic with elevation defined by background color shifts or hairline borders.
- Refrain from using thin, light fonts for body copy; ensure sufficient contrast and readability with Ink (#1a1a1a) and appropriate weights.
- Do not deviate from the established 8px and 12px radii for buttons and cards; these values define the component softness.
- Avoid overly dense layouts or packing too much information into one section; maintain the spacious rhythm with generous padding and section gaps.
- Do not use browser default link colors; all links should be styled with Ink (#1a1a1a) and rely on subtle hover effects for interaction.
