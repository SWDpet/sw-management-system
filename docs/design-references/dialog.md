## Overview

Dialog feels like a high-end retail floor plan rendered in digital form — neutral, airy, and unhurried, with one warm accent that acts like a price tag sticker on white linen. The #f7f7f7 near-white background and pure white cards create a surface hierarchy so subtle it reads as continuous space rather than layered depth. PP Radio Grotesk Light at 50-70px is the defining move: a geometric grotesque rendered at its lightest weight makes large headlines feel handwritten on paper rather than stamped — zero aggression, maximum presence. The single orange #f69251 appears exclusively on CTAs, pulling attention the way a sale tag pops in a neutral showroom. Pill-shaped buttons (28px radius) float against square-cornered containers, the only soft shape in an otherwise rectilinear system.

## Colors

| Name | Hex | Group | Role |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Tangerine Tag | `#f69251` | brand | Primary CTA buttons, 'Book a demo' pill — warm orange against near-white backgrounds signals action without urgency, echoing the palette of premium retail labels |
| Midnight Ink | `#181825` | neutral | Body text, borders — near-black with a barely perceptible blue undertone, softer than pure black for long-form reading |
| Graphite | `#484758` | neutral | Secondary body text, descriptive copy, meta information |
| Deep Slate | `#242433` | neutral | Dark surface backgrounds, card overlays in dark sections |
| Carbon | `#000000` | neutral | Headings, icon fills, primary text — used at full weight for maximum legibility |
| Stone | `#636363` | neutral | Supporting body text, nav labels, secondary labels |
| Pebble | `#949494` | neutral | Placeholder text, muted links, disabled states |
| Ash | `#8b8b8b` | neutral | Tertiary text, icon strokes, faint borders |
| Fog | `#f7f7f7` | neutral | Page background, section fills — the dominant surface of the entire site |
| Snow | `#ffffff` | neutral | Card surfaces, nav background, button fill for ghost variant |
| Peach Whisper | `#fad7c1` | accent | Decorative SVG fills, illustration accent highlights |
| Dusty Rose | `#c97b84` | accent | Semantic accent — appears in hover or highlight states on certain interactive elements |

## Typography

| fontFeatureSettings | "blwf", "cv03", "cv04", "cv09", "cv11" |
| substitute | Satoshi Light, DM Sans Light |
| role | All hero and section headings. Weight 400 in this geometric grotesque renders visually as 'light' — at 70px the type feels pencil-drawn rather than set, giving large-format headlines an editorial quality no system font can replicate. The signature typographic move of this site. |

### Inter

| substitute | Inter (already Google-available) |
| role | Navigation labels, body copy, input fields, UI labels, subheadings. Weight 400 for body, 500 for nav links and emphasis. The negative letter-spacing is tighter than Inter's default, compressing the text block slightly without feeling cramped. |

## Components

### Email Input + CTA Inline Form with Star Ratings

### Testimonial Card

### Product Screenshot Browser Frame

### Primary CTA Button (Orange Pill)

**Role:** Hero and nav primary action — 'Book a demo'

Background #f69251, text #000000, border-radius 28px, padding 12px 24px. The fully pill-shaped silhouette at 28px radius is the only rounded element class in an otherwise angular layout. Subtle layered shadow: rgba(0,0,0,0.04) 0px 1px 2px, rgba(0,0,0,0.02) 0px 2px 4px, rgba(0,0,0,0.02) 0px 4px 8px. Font: Inter 14-16px weight 500.

### Ghost CTA Button (White Pill)

**Role:** Secondary actions on dark or image-backed surfaces

Background #ffffff, text #000000, border-radius 28px, padding 12px 24px. Same pill shape as primary, but inverted to white fill — reads as outline-adjacent without an explicit border. Used where orange would clash with background.

### Email Input + CTA Inline Form

**Role:** Hero email capture row

Input field: transparent background, border-radius 0px, no padding — appears as a bare underline or bordered rectangle. Paired inline with the orange pill button. Input text #000000, placeholder color #949494 (Pebble). The zero-radius input contrasts sharply with the 28px pill button beside it, creating a deliberate tension between form and function.

### Testimonial Card

**Role:** Social proof in scrolling testimonials section

White (#ffffff) card surface, border-radius 24px, padding 24px. Quote text in Inter 14-16px #181825. Author name in Inter 500 ~14px, role/handle in #636363 Inter 400 12-13px. Avatar image displayed at small size (32-40px) with circular crop. No border — card lifts via box-shadow rgba(24,24,37,0.12) 0px 2px 3px -2px. Placed in a horizontal scroll carousel.

### Product Screenshot Browser Frame

**Role:** Product tour / hero UI illustration

White (#ffffff) card at border-radius 24px with decorative browser chrome: three colored dots (red #c97b84, yellow, green) in top-left at 12px circles. Interior filled with skeleton placeholder blocks at #f7f7f7 and #b2b2b2. Card uses rgba(247,247,247,0.5) 0px -40px 40px 0px shadow at bottom edge — a fade-up vignette that blends the mockup into the page background.

### Navigation Bar

**Role:** Global top navigation

White (#ffffff) background, height ~64px, max-width contained. Logo (Dialog wordmark with arrow icon) left-aligned. Links in Inter 400 14px #636363, spacing 6-8px gaps. 'Book a demo' orange pill button right-aligned. Border-radius 32px on the nav container when scrolled (floating pill nav pattern). No visible bottom border — separates from page via background contrast.

### Feature Badge / Pill Label

**Role:** Category tags, section labels like 'AI product recommender'

Border-radius 100px, background white or #f7f7f7, padding 4-8px 12px. Text Inter 500 12-13px #484758. No colored background — neutral pill that organizes content without adding chroma.

### Section Heading Block

**Role:** Main headline + supporting subtext for each content section

Headline: PP Radio Grotesk Light 50px, letter-spacing -0.01em, color #000000, line-height 1.20. Subtext: Inter 400 16-18px #636363, line-height 1.50. Vertically stacked, center-aligned in hero, left-aligned in feature sections. Gap between headline and subtext: 12-16px.

### Star Rating Row

**Role:** Social proof trust indicators below hero CTA

Inline row of icon + 5-star glyphs in #f69251 orange. Icon badge (Shopify/G2 logo) at 20px followed by five ★ characters. Text Inter 400 12px #636363. Two rating rows displayed side-by-side with 16-24px gap. Acts as micro-credibility anchor beneath the email capture form.

## Layout

Max-width ~1200px centered on a #f7f7f7 full-bleed background. Hero is a center-stack layout: headline in PP Radio Grotesk at 70px, subtext, then inline email+CTA form, then trust-badge row — all vertically centered with generous whitespace (~120px top padding). The browser mockup floats below, cropped at the bottom viewport edge to hint at scrollable content. Below: alternating content sections using left-aligned headline + body text paired with right-side UI mockups (2-column). Testimonial section breaks the grid into a horizontal scroll carousel with 3-column partial cards visible. Navigation is a floating white pill (border-radius 32px) that appears contained within a header band — minimal, no mega-menu, no sidebar.

## Imagery

Two modes of imagery coexist. Product screenshots are rendered as browser-chrome wireframe mockups on white card surfaces — functional and diagrammatic, showing the AI chat interface UI rather than lifestyle. Customer testimonials in the second section use editorial photography: close-cropped product still life (perfume bottle, textured surface) and brand identity shots (Delsey luggage, car dashboard detail). These are contained within 24px-radius cards in a horizontal carousel, with no full-bleed photography on the main page. Photography is warm-toned and moody — shot in ambient/low light, desaturated with brown or bronze casts. The contrast between the clinical wireframe mockups and the warm editorial photos is deliberate: product as system, proof as atmosphere.

## Elevation philosophy

Shadows are used at near-invisible intensity — rgba(24,24,37,0.12) at 2px blur and rgba(0,0,0,0.04) layered micro-shadows on buttons. The effect is less about lifting surfaces and more about defining their edges against the #f7f7f7 background. Cards do not compete for vertical attention; they sit in the plane. The rgba(247,247,247,0.5) 0px -40px 40px fade on the browser mockup is the most dramatic shadow on the page, and it fades INTO the background color — erasing depth rather than creating it.

## Dos & Donts

### Do

- Use PP Radio Grotesk Light (weight 400) exclusively for headings at 32px+; never substitute Inter for headlines at large sizes
- Apply #f69251 only to primary CTA buttons — never to text, icons, decorative shapes, or backgrounds
- Set all buttons to border-radius 28px (pill shape) regardless of button width; this is the only rounded UI element in the system
- Maintain #f7f7f7 as the page background and #ffffff for all card surfaces — the 2-tone near-white surface system defines the visual plane
- Use Inter at -0.01em to -0.02em letter-spacing for body and nav text — never at default or positive tracking
- Set card shadows to rgba(24,24,37,0.12) 0px 2px 3px -2px — single low-offset shadow, never stacked high-elevation shadows
- Give testimonial and feature cards border-radius 24px with 24px internal padding — do not use smaller radii for large containers

### Don't

- Do not use #f69251 for more than one element category (CTAs only) — introducing orange to icons, text, or decoration breaks the single-accent discipline
- Do not apply border-radius less than 24px to card containers — 8px or 12px radii belong to inner UI chips, not layout-level cards
- Do not use bold or heavy weights (600+) with PP Radio Grotesk — the light grotesque loses its identity at high weight
- Do not introduce colored section backgrounds (blue, green, purple bands) — section variation comes from #f7f7f7 vs #ffffff swaps only
- Do not use drop shadows larger than 8px blur or opacity above 0.12 — the elevation system is deliberately flush with the page plane
- Do not crop or bleed photography to page edges on interior pages — photography lives inside 24px-radius card containers only
- Do not set input fields to a rounded border-radius — inputs use 0px or minimal radius to contrast with the pill button system
